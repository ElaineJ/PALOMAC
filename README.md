# PALOMAC (Prevention and Localisation of Missing Autistic Children)
### Problem Statement
##### Autistic children have a tendency to wander on the spur of the moment, to pursue anything which occupies their thoughts. This is dangerous, especially since they are unable to seek help when lost, and have poor sense of danger.

### Needs Statement
##### There needs to be a way to detect when these children are about to wander beyond visible sight of the caregiver, and locate them quickly, to prevent them from harm.
